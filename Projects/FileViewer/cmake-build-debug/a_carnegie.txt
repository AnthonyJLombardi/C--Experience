Andrew Carnegie /kɑːrˈneɪɡi/ kar-NAY-gee[3][4] (November 25, 1835 – August 11, 1919) was a Scottish-American industrialist, business magnate, 
and philanthropist. Carnegie led the expansion of the American steel industry in the late 19th century and became one of the richest Americans 
in history. He became a leading philanthropist in the United States and in the British Empire. During the last 18 years of his life, he gave 
away $350 million (conservatively $65 billion in 2019 dollars, based on percentage of GDP) to charities, foundations, and universities – almost 
90 percent of his fortune. His 1889 article proclaiming "The Gospel of Wealth" called on the rich to use their wealth to improve society, and 
stimulated a wave of philanthropy.
