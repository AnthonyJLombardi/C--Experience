Potsdam was founded by Benjamin Raymond in 1816 as the St. Lawrence Academy. In 1834, the academy was chosen by the 
New York State Legislature to exclusively offer a teacher education program for its senatorial district. With funds 
from the state, and from support by preceptor Reverend Asa Brainerd, the first diploma in teaching was given in 
1836, thus beginning the academy's and eventually the college's longstanding tradition of excellence in the field 
of teacher education. <br>

In 1866, the State Legislature ended its funding of teacher education departments in private academies, and began 
establishing several normal schools throughout the state. The Village of Potsdam was thus named as one of four 
locations for new normal schools, and in 1867, the St. Lawrence Academy became the Potsdam Normal School. <br>

By 1886, the Potsdam Normal School had become the first institution in the United States to offer a normal training 
course for public school music teachers in the United States. Founded by Julia E. Crane, the Crane Normal Institute 
of Music continues today as the world-renowned Crane School of Music as a leader in the field of music education.
